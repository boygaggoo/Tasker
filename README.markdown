# Tasker

## Introduction
Tasker is a really simple task management application for Android. It is intended as a foray into Android development, so it will probably not have the best practices as it starts out. Also it probably won't ever make it to the Android Marketplace. The application takes it's initial basis from the example Notes application provided as a tutorial from http://developer.android.com.
There will be an accompanying series of blog posts at http://beyondtc.wordpress.com to document my experiences with Android.
